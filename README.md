This repository serves as a collection of Python examples showcasing 
the integration and utilization of various NN and ML libraries with data 
generated by the D.AT platform, a pioneering platform for in AI stock predictions.

Whether you're a beginner seeking to delve into the world of stock predictions, or an 
experienced developer looking to fine-tune your models, this repository serves as a 
resource to guide you in developing sophisticated stock prediction models using
[D.AT's data setups](https://d.at/ref/github-python-examples).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies using the command :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
## About the Example Data
The data provided in `example_data` is an example of what is provided as a D.AT data delivery.

This dataset encapsulates 5 years of stock data from the S&P 500, 
segmented into intervals of 30 trading days each. The data in each segment 
has been normalized using a method where values are divided by the most 
recent data point within the segment. Each row in the dataset represents a 
specific segment, providing a snapshot of the stock data available on a 
particular trading day. Moreover, rows are labeled to indicate whether the 
stock experienced a minimum gain of 5% within the subsequent 10 trading days.

* `train.csv`: Of the 5 years, it contains the first 4 years of data.
* `test.csv`: Of the 5 years, it contains the final year of data.
* `latest.csv`: This file contains data from the most recent trading 
day for all stocks listed. While it lacks labels (since these pertain to future events), 
each row maintains the same feature vector structure as those in the `train` and `test` 
files. The rows commence with the stock ticker symbol, serving as a key tool to pinpoint 
stocks with promising prospects for good performance.
